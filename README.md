# Resturent-website-
This project was about building a dynamic restaurant website using JavaScript and Webpack. It features tabbed navigation, where Home, Menu, and Contact sections load dynamically. Webpack handles bundling, making the project modular and efficient. This improves JavaScript skills and front-end development practices. ðŸš€
